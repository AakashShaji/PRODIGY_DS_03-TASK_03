## Description
This project analyzes a bank marketing campaign dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and classification modeling using decision tree classifiers. The project uses Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.## Analysis Highlights

### Data Preprocessing

- **Loading and Inspecting Data:** The dataset is loaded, and an initial inspection is performed to understand its structure and content.
- **Handling Duplicates:** Duplicate rows are identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
- **Feature Renaming:** Columns are renamed for better readability and understanding.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Numerical Feature Visualization:** Histograms are created for numerical features to understand their distributions.
- **Categorical Feature Visualization:** Count plots are generated for categorical features to observe their frequency distributions.
- **Outlier Removal:** Outliers are detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to enhance data quality.
- **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix heatmap is created to identify relationships between numerical features.

### Feature Engineering

- **Encoding Categorical Features:** Label encoding is applied to convert categorical features into numerical format.
- **Removing Highly Correlated Features:** Features with high correlation are removed to reduce multicollinearity, improving model performance.

### Modeling

- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** A decision tree classifier is built using both Gini impurity and entropy criteria.
- **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using training and testing accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Results

- **Training and Testing Accuracy:** The decision tree models achieve high accuracy on both training and testing datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix:** The confusion matrix provides insight into the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates.
- **Classification Report:** The report includes precision, recall, and F1-score, offering a comprehensive evaluation of model performance.
